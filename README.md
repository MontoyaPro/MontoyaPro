Hello, My name is Lucas Montoya and I am currently building my coding skills in order to get a job as a software developer. I know C and C++ currently and am trying to learn Python and Javascript and maybe some SQL.

On my page you can find my finished projects as well as updates on projects that I am currently working on. If you are looking to contact me you can reach me at lucasmontoya1996@gmail.com
